    //User Story 11: As a developer, I want to create a PaymentGateway interface with methods for processing payments, and have PayPal and CreditCard classes implement it.
    //Explanation:
    //Create a PaymentGateway interface with method declarations for processing payments.
    //Implement separate PayPal and CreditCard classes that implement the PaymentGateway interface and provide specific implementations for payment processing.
    //Use interfaces to define a common set of operations for payment processing that can be implemented by different payment methods.
