    //User Story 13: As a developer, I want to create an Animal interface with a method called "eat" and have Dog and Cat classes implement it.
    //Explanation:
    //Create an Animal interface with a method declaration for "eat" that has no implementation.
    //Implement separate Dog and Cat classes that implement the Animal interface and provide specific implementations for the "eat" method.
    //Use interfaces to define a common behavior (eating) that is implemented differently by different animal types.

    public void eat();
}
