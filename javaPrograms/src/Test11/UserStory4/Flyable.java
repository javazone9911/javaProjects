    //User Story 4: As a developer, I want to design an interface called Flyable with a method called "fly" and have Bird and Airplane classes implement it.
    //Explanation:
    //Create a Flyable interface with a method declaration for "fly" that has no implementation.
    //Implement separate Bird and Airplane classes that implement the Flyable interface and provide specific implementations for the "fly" method.
    //Use interfaces to define a common behavior (flying) that can be implemented by different classes.

    public void fly();
}
